# iframe communication

This is a simple trivial demo of how to add a block of code to an angular app, which will allow a parent frame to control the app.

The [Bellhop Iframe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bellhop-iframe) library provides a simple means of communicating messages between windows.

See `src/assets/ng` for the Angular app, and `src/app/components/IFrameCommunication` component for the React side.
